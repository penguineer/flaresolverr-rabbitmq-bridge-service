## Contributing

PRs are welcome!

If possible, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Keep PRs reasonably small and their scope limited to a feature or module within the code.
* If a large change is planned, it is best to open a feature request issue first, then link subsequent PRs to this
  issue, so that the PRs move the code towards the intended feature.

If you miss a LaTeX package, which cannot be included in the request archive, or miss a language, please do not hesitate
to open an issue or PR.
